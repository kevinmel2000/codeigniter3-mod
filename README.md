1. Tools like artisan in Laravel: Make Models, Controller, Migration, and run Seeder is available
2. The database.php.example and config.php.example to keep database.php and config.php safe
3. Add belongsTo and hasMany in the system/core/Model.php to add deal with relationship
4. File index.php on the public/ directory

## Installation

2. Copy database.php.example to database.php and set the DB of your own
3. Copy config.php.example to config.php and set the Config of your own
